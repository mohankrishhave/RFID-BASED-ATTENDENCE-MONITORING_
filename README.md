# RFID-BASED-ATTENDENCE-MONITORING_

RFID attendance system is used to take attendance for student in school, college, and university. By placing their ID cards on the reader, students or workers can 

immediately verify their attendance.

RFID reader collects data in stored in the RFID tag . we have two types of tags , they are active and passive tag. In our project we 

are used passive tag .The passive tah doesn't contain battery , it takes energy from RFID reader. when radio waves come from RFID 

reader are encountered by passive tag , within the tag it froms nmagnetic field.

To mark attendence automatically for students or staff need to carry the RFID tag it contains unique information such as name, 

section,id

#Components we used in the project

* NodeMCU
* MFRC522 RFID Reader
* RFID Tags ( 13.56 MHz )
* Bread Board
* Jumper Wires
* LEDS

#WORKING PRINCPLE

Radio-Frequency Identification (RFID) is the use of radio waves to read and capture information stored on a tag attached to an object.
A RFID reader is a device used to gather information from an RFID tag, which is used to track individual objects. 
Radio waves are used to transfer data from the tag to a reader.
A passive tag is an RFID tag that does not contain a battery, the power is supplied by the reader. When radio waves from the reader are encountered by a passive RFID tag, the coiled antenna within the tag forms a magnetic field. 
The tag draws power from it, energizing the circuits in the tag
